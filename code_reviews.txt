We found this beneficial because the reviewer provided clear and defined reasons for each issue they identified in the code. They also provided examples of how the submitter could change the code to fix the issues. This shows that the reviewer had a good understanding of the code.

We found this to be not beneficial because the reviewer points out issues but does not show how to fix them. The reviewer also made many disrespectful comments. A recommendation to improve this code review would be to keep the comments constructive rather than rude, and back up reasons for pointing out issues.
